This blog is about my experience. My experience with fashion and food, and because I love
them both so much, I thought I'd share my thought with the world. Join me on this interesting
journey through the world, with a different perspective. Stick with me, and I assure you that your
time will not be in vain. Enjoy my words, my world, and most of all, the pictures.
